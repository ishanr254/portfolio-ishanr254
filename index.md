**Hi — I’m Ishan**, an engineering student at Cornell interested in flight‑vehicle design and data‑driven finance.
On campus I work on Cornell Design‑Build‑Fly (structures, sizing/optimization) and a Magnus‑effect UAV concept.
I also build quantitative models around REIT/mortgage and microfinance datasets.
